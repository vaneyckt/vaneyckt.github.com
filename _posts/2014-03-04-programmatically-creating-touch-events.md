Recent versions of Android have the super useful `adb shell input touch` functionality to simulate touch events on an Android device or simulator. However, older Android versions (like 2.3) do not support this command. In those cases you can use `adb shell getevent` to investigate which events are generated by touching a particular part of the screen. These events can then be replayed by using `adb shell sendevent`.

An important caveat is that while `adb shell getevent` might show you the following

the `adb shell sendevent` command expects all input to be decimal! Note that 462 and 898 are the x and y coords of the touch event.
