[Fucking Shell Scripts](http://fuckingshellscripts.org) provides a super simple way to deploy your application with shell scripts. I understand that this is not a magic bullet solution and probably won't work on an enterprise level, but it could have a place as a mechanism to quickly deploy open-source software. I know I would like it if a Github repository had a shell script that would quickly get the software deployed so I could immediately move on to evaluating it.
