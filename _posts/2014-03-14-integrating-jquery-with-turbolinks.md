Turbolinks are a cool new rails 4 feature that unfortunately doesn't always mess well with jQuery. You will most likely become aware of this when you spot your javascript code not always getting triggered. This is probably caused by turbolinks preventing jQuery's 'ready' event from getting fired on subsequent clicks.

Luckily there's an easy fix for this in the form of [jquery.turbolinks](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks). Just follow the excellent instructions and you should have everything working in no time.
