Rails has an amazing [NumberHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper.html#method-i-number_to_human) that makes converting numbers into properly formatted currencies, file sizes, phone numbers, more readable numbers, ... super easy. It even supports locales to ensure the formatting matches regional standards.
