An application that interacts with external services can be difficult to test. Luckily the [vcr gem](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) can help you with this. It's a simple API that records the HTTP traffic generated by your tests on their first run, and will then replay the stored responses on any subsequent run. This will ensure your tests will still pass even if the external service were to go down for a bit.
