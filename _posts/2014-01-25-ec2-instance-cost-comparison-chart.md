Amazon's pricing scheme for its ec2 instances never struck me as particularly transparent. Until recently some of my colleagues even estimated costs by cross-referencing [instance details](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/instance-details/) with [pricing information](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/). While this approach gives reasonable results for finding the cost of a given instance type, it doesn't lend itself very well to comparing prices across a range of different types.

When talking to an ex-colleague of mine about the hardships encountered for such a common task, he pointed me to [this absolutely brilliant page](http://www.ec2instances.info/). It's so unbelievably simple and well thought-out that I can't help getting ever so slightly annoyed with whomever is in charge of communicating Amazon's pricing structure and the subpar job they are doing.
