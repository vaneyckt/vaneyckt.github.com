StackOverflow has the best [concise explanations](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2189452/when-to-use-margin-vs-padding-in-css):

- margin is on the outside of block elements while padding is on the inside
- use margin to separate the block from things outside it
- use padding to move the contents away from the edges of the block
- favor using margin, except when you have a border or background and want to increase the space inside that visible box

However, these explanations overlook [margin collapsing](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins):

- when the vertical margins of two elements are touching, only the margin of the element with the largest margin value will be honored
- if one element has a negative margin, the margin values are added together to determine the final value
- if both are negative, the greater negative value is used

Note that margin collapsing only occurs for vertical margins.

There are some exceptions to this as well. Margin collapsing does not occur for the following elements:

- floated elements
- absolutely positioned elements
- inline-block elements
- elements with overflow set to anything other than visible do not collapse margins with their children
- cleared elements do not collapse their top margins with their parent blockâ€™s bottom margin
- the root element
