      <description>A lot of digital ink has been spilled on this subject, so I figured it might be worth to briefly talk about this. You can either change the orientation through ADB or through an app. While the ADB approach is the easiest, it might not work on all devices or on all Android versions. For example, the dumpsys output of a Kindle Fire is different than that of a Samsung Galaxy S4, so you might need to tweak the grepping of the output.</description>

      <description>Recent versions of Android have the adb shell input touch functionality to simulate touch events on an Android device or simulator. However, older Android versions (like 2.3) do not support this command. Luckily it is possible to recreate this functionality by running adb shell getevent to capture events as they are being generated. These events can then later be replayed using the adb shell sendevent command.
Running adb shell getevent when touching the screen might get you something like shown below.</description>
