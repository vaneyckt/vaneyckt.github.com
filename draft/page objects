capybara acts as a wrapper around selenium
selenium talk to chrome driver - which acts like a server - with the JSON wire protocol over curb (DEFAULT: NET:HTTP)
chromedrive talks to chrome

note that the chromedriver does not need to live in the Capybara codebase:
https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
Whatever is returned from the block should conform to the API described by Capybara::Driver::Base, it does not however have to inherit from this class. Gems can use this API to add their own drivers to Capybara.
