Today I learned that Android API level 8 and lower does [not support String.isEmpty()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5244927/cant-call-string-isempty-in-android). Keep this is mind when youâ€™re working on an app that needs to be able to run on older phones and use `String.length() == 0` instead.
